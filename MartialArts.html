<h2>MartialArts</h2>
<p>
Dear Pupilfirst Team, <br>
    The animation is working absolutely fine in my desktop but after uploading on github, it is not working, as images are unable to load. The screenshots has been uploaded on the discussion forum but till 10:50 PM (06-Sep-2021), I haven't received any reply from your side.
    So, i uploaded the link of github to complete the final task of WD101.
    I will be happy, if I will get the solution.
    Thanks
